## What is Heal4me
Heal4Me is an online platform focused on providing its users with the resources to combat mental illness and provide meaningful support during their times of need. 

We aim to create an semi-anonymous social networking platform that's more comfortable, convenient, accessible, and/or affordable (free) than in-person group meetings or therapy. Heal4Me is online 24/7 to lend support to those in need.

While Heal4Me is predominantly a crowdsourced emotional and mental health support service, akin to a virtual 24/7 Alcoholics Anonymous, this project's defining feature is our recommendation algorithm. Using our algorithm, users can browse suggested groups and posts, as well as a variety of resources like books and meditation tutorials.
