# Style Guidelines
Heal4Me style guidelines are the perfect marriage between legible usefulness and flexibility. We ask contributors to follow the style guidelines below.

### Brackets
Heal4Me uses Stroustrup style, a variant of K&R, in which K&R extends to functions and classes, not just the blocks inside the function. All these brackets have their opening braces on the same line as their respective control statements; closing braces remain in a line of their own, unless followed by a keyword, such as else or while.
```
function partyAtHq(num_Heal4Me_users) {
   if (num_Heal4Me_users >= 1000000) {
      console.log("Party at Heal4Me HQ!");
   }
}
```

### Tabs/Spacing
Heal4Me uses tabs to organize and format all code. Our definition of a tab consists of 4 spaces.

### Git Commit Messages
All commit messages through Git must follow the following format:
**Type of Commit | Files Related to Commit | Further description of what was done**
- Type of Commit - Are you adding a file, removing a file, refactoring a file, better documenting a file, etc?
- Files Related to Commit - The files that were changed. If everything below a directory was modified/created/removed, feel free to simple give the directory. The files must listed in [Oxford Comma Format](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/).
- Finally, describe in more detail what has been done to the file in question.
```
git commit -m "add | new_file.c | A new file was created for the purpose of..."
```

### Variable and Function Names
**Variable Names**
Both variables and function names are lowercase and underscored, using snake case  style guidleines. Snake case is the practice practice of "writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character... and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper- or lowercaseâ€”as in 'foo_bar' and 'Hello_world'" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)). Keep note, however, that as mentioned above, our implementation of snake case variables and functions will strictly be all lowercase.

```
int heal4me_var;
simple_heal4me_function()
```

### File Names
Files that must be easy to find when visiting a repository must be entirely capitalized, in which multiple words are separated by underscores. These files apply to anything that a new user must immediately see once coming across this repository for the first time, such as the README, LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and of course, this file, STYLE_GUIDELINES. These files must be located in the home (highest) directory of the repository, unless you plan on including additional README files withing subdirectories to describe its contents. Another exception with README.md is the naming format, in which separate words should not be underscored.

Any other file will follow a lowercase, snake case format. As used and explained in more depth above under "Variable and Function Names," each word is separated by an underscore, all consisting of lowercase letters.
